# Flight_Itinerary_system
This project focuses on building an intelligent flight itinerary planner that efficiently determines the shortest and most optimized routes between multiple cities using Dijkstra’s Algorithm and the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

🧭 Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to compute the shortest path between the source and destination airports, ensuring minimal travel time or cost.

🔄 TSP Algorithm is implemented to find the most efficient circular route that visits a list of cities exactly once and returns to the origin, ideal for multi-city trip planning.

 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Graph Data Structures
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Travelling Salesman Problem (Brute-force / Greedy / Heuristic approach)
